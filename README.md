Welcome to the bodyweight fitness helper. This program assists in learning 
various bodyweight exercises that target all the muscle groups in your body, 
starting from the very basics! So far, only squats have been implemented.
For now, this is a program that can help people learn to do good squats. 

The information comes from an exercise program designed by Nick Janvier and is fully 
accessible from startbodyweight.com. The goal of this Python script is to design a 
user interface that can cleanly display the information in a format that is digestible,
which can help the user more easily begin the exercises."""
